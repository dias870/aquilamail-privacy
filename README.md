# Privacy Policy – SMS to Email Forwarder (AquilaMail)

This repository hosts the public **privacy policy** for the Android app:

> **SMS to Email Forwarder (AquilaMail)**  
> An app that automatically forwards incoming SMS messages to one or multiple email addresses, with filters and rules.

The HTML file `privacy-policy.html` is published via **GitHub Pages** and used as the privacy policy URL in **Google Play Console**.

## Usage

- The app processes SMS and (optionally) contacts **locally on the device**.
- Emails are sent directly from the device to the SMTP server configured by the user.
- No analytics or tracking SDK is integrated.
- We do not store SMS or contacts on any external server.

If you are a user of the app, you can read the full privacy policy here:
